The recipe for a classic apple pie:

Ingredients:

For the crust:

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
6-8 tablespoons ice water
For the filling:

6-8 medium-sized apples (such as Granny Smith or Honeycrisp), peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
Instructions:

Prepare the crust:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar.
Add the chilled, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Gradually add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with a fork, until the dough comes together.
Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape each into a disk, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Prepare the filling:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Toss until the apples are evenly coated.
Roll out the dough:

On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disk of dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to a 9-inch pie dish, gently pressing it into the bottom and sides.
Assemble the pie:

Pour the apple filling into the prepared pie crust, spreading it out evenly.
Dot the top of the filling with small pieces of butter.
Top the pie:

Roll out the second disk of dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. You can either place the whole dough circle on top of the filling or cut it into strips to create a lattice pattern.
If using a whole dough circle, cut a few slits in the center to allow steam to escape during baking.
Bake the pie:

Place the assembled pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips) and bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
Cool and serve:

Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before serving. Serve slices of apple pie warm or at room temperature, optionally topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
Enjoy your homemade apple pie!
